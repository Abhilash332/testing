        <p>There is none who cares poor in this world of money loving people. But there used to be a man named Ratan Tata 
            who lives simple though he is rich. He is the founder of Jaguar,Rover and many other tech and non-tech companies 
            but used to travel in nano produced by tata which has impacted negatively on people of India due to some issues.
            Though he is a founder of those companies, he hasn't travelled much in those cars but many people who buy and 
            travel in them used to have much ego, jealous of others and showcasing others in such a way as to pretend them to 
            be rich. This attitude must be changed.
